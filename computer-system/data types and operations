Actually,the electronic circuits in the computer differentiate voltages close to 0 from voltages far from 0.
To get useful work done by the computer ,it is necessary to be able to identify uniquely a large number of distinct values.
In gerneral,with k bits,we can distinguish at most 2^k distinct items.
We say a particular representation is a datatype if there are operations in the computer that can operate on information that is encoded in tat representation.
Unsigened integers also provide a means for identifying different memory locations in the computers
